                 My goal in life is to show my children that setting goals and achieving them is one of the best feelings they will get to experience in life. That there maybe times where their goals are not met but it is ok. They don't need to give up. Just keep trying and reach for the stars. That is what I am doing now with learning to code HTML. I always been intersted in learning to code and all the good things learning this course comes with.
